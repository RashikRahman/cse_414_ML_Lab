# When to use what (quick rules):
# - Mean/Std: good for roughly normal numeric features (but sensitive to outliers)
# - Median/IQR: robust summaries when outliers/skew exist
# - Min-Max normalization: when you want [0,1] scaling (but outlier-sensitive)
# - Z-score standardization: common default for many ML algorithms
# - ±3σ rule: simple outlier rule for near-normal data
# - IQR rule: robust outlier rule for skewed/non-normal data
